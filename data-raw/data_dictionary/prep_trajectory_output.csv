dataset,column,typeof,definition
prep_trajectory_output,sector,character,The sector of the technology
prep_trajectory_output,technology,character,The technology
prep_trajectory_output,year,integer,The year of the data
prep_trajectory_output,region,character,The region for which the analysis has been run. Indicates which production assets have been considered and which scenario region is used
prep_trajectory_output,scenario_source,character,The publication the scenario data is based on
prep_trajectory_output,metric,character,"Indicates if the production related values refer to the projected activities of the underlying counterparty, to the economy wide benchmark, or to allocated levels of activity based on the scenarios"
prep_trajectory_output,production,double,"The production level of the given 'metric'"
prep_trajectory_output,technology_share,double,"The share of the 'production' the given 'technology' relative to all technologies of the corresponding 'sector' for the gien combination of 'group_id', 'region', 'year' and 'metric'"
prep_trajectory_output,scope,character,"Indicates if the targets for the given technology have been calculated based on the TMSR (technology) or the SMSP (sector). High-carbon technologies that need to decrease have their targets calculated on the technology level, whereas low-carbon technologies that need to increase have them calculated on the sector level"
prep_trajectory_output,percentage_of_initial_production_by_scope,double,Relative change compared to the start value (by scope). Used for displaying the change in activity over time on a common scale
prep_trajectory_output,label,character,"Same as 'metric', formatted for display in plot"
prep_trajectory_output,value,double,"Same as 'percentage_of_initial_production_by_scope', for display in plot"
