The goal of r2dii.plot is to help you plot 2DII data in an informative,
beautiful, and easy way.

## Installation

You can install the released version of r2dii.plot from CRAN with:

``` r
install.packages("r2dii.plot")
```

And the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.plot")
```

## Example

The r2dii.plot package is designed to work smoothly with other “r2dii”
packages –
[r2dii.data](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.data/),
[r2dii.match](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/), and
[r2dii.analysis](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/).
It also plays well with the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/)
package, which helps you customize your plots. Here, we’ll use an
example data set that comes with r2dii.plot and that resembles the
output of the
[`target_market_share()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/reference/target_market_share.html)
function in the r2dii.analysis package.

``` r
library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(r2dii.plot)
```

### Plot trajectory chart

-   Use `qplot_*()` to quickly get a plot with standard titles and
    labels.

``` r
# `data` must meet documented "Requirements"
data <- market_share %>%
  filter(
    sector == "power",
    technology == "renewablescap",
    region == "global",
    scenario_source == "demo_2020"
  )

qplot_trajectory(data)
```

-   Use `plot_*()` for a more “bare” plot that you can customize
    yourself by modifying the input data and applying `ggplot2`
    functions.

``` r
data <- market_share %>%
  filter(
    sector == "power",
    technology == "renewablescap",
    region == "global",
    scenario_source == "demo_2020",
    between(year, 2020, 2035)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    label = case_when(
      metric == "projected" ~ "Your Portfolio",
      metric == "corporate_economy" ~ "Benchmark (Corp. Econ.)",
      metric == "target_sds" ~ "SDS Scenario",
      metric == "target_sps" ~ "SPS Scenario",
      metric == "target_cps" ~ "CPS Scenario",
      TRUE ~ metric
    )
  )

plot_trajectory(data) +
  labs(
    title = "Power production trajectory for Renewables",
    subtitle = "With reference to climate scenarios.",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Production (normalized to 2020)"
  )
#> Warning: The `data` argument of `plot_trajectory()` must be prepped already as of r2dii.plot 0.4.0.
#> • From the next release you will need to call `r2dii.plot::plot_trajectory(data)`
#> prior to calling `r2dii.plot::plot_trajectory()`.
#> • Alternatively custom data preparation will also become possible.
```
