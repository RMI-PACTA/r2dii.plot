Description: Create plots to visualize the alignment of a corporate
    lending financial portfolio to climate change scenarios based on
    climate indicators (production and emission intensities) across key
    climate relevant sectors of the 'PACTA' methodology (Paris Agreement
    Capital Transition Assessment; <https://2degrees-investing.org/>).
    Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
    allocation decisions align with climate change mitigation goals.
