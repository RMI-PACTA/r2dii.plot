Description: Create plots to visualize the alignment of a corporate
    lending portfolio to climate change scenarios based on climate
    indicators (production and emission intensities) across key climate
    relevant sectors of the 'PACTA' methodology (Paris Agreement Capital
    Transition Assessment;
    <https://www.transitionmonitor.com/pacta-for-banks-2020/methodology-and-supporting-materials/>).
    Financial institutions use 'PACTA' to study how their capital
    allocation decisions align with climate change mitigation goals.
