The goal of r2dii.plot is to help you plot 2DII data in an informative,
beautiful, and easy way.

## Installation

You can install the released version of r2dii.plot from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("r2dii.plot")
```

And the development version from GitHub with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("2DegreesInvesting/r2dii.plot")
```

## Example

The r2dii.plot package is designed to work smoothly with other "r2dii" packages
-- [r2dii.data](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.data/),
[r2dii.match](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.match/), and
[r2dii.analysis](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/). It also
plays well with the [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package, which
helps you customize your plots. Here, we'll use an example data set that comes
with r2dii.plot and that resembles the output of the
[`target_market_share()`](https://2degreesinvesting.github.io/r2dii.analysis/reference/target_market_share.html)
function in the r2dii.analysis package.

```{r setup}
library(ggplot2, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(r2dii.plot)
```

### Plot trajectory chart

* Use `qplot_*()` to quickly get a plot with standard titles and labels. 

```{r}
# `data` must meet documented "Requirements"
data <- market_share %>%
  filter(
    sector == "power",
    technology == "oilcap",
    region == "global",
    scenario_source == "demo_2020"
  )

qplot_trajectory(data)
```

* Use `plot_*()` for a more "bare" plot that you can customize yourself by 
modifying the input data and applying `ggplot2` functions. 

```{r}
data <- market_share %>%
  filter(
    sector == "power",
    technology == "renewablescap",
    region == "global",
    scenario_source == "demo_2020",
    between(year, 2020, 2035)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    label = case_when(
      metric == "projected" ~ "Your Portfolio",
      metric == "corporate_economy" ~ "Benchmark (Corp. Econ.)",
      metric == "target_sds" ~ "SDS Scenario",
      metric == "target_sps" ~ "SPS Scenario",
      metric == "target_cps" ~ "CPS Scenario",
      TRUE ~ metric
    )
  )

plot_trajectory(data) +
  labs(
    title = "Power production trajectory for Renewables",
    subtitle = "With reference to climate scenarios.",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Production (normalized to 2020)"
  )
```
